# Instagram Clone Dataset Analytics SQL Project ( Udemy Course)

## Project Overview

This project is a capstone for Colt Steele's Udemy SQL course, focusing on analyzing an Instagram-like dataset using SQL queries. The project simulates a simplified version of Instagram's database structure and explores various analytical questions using SQL.

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

- Users: Central table connected to all other entities
- Photos: Stores image URLs and associated user information
- Comments: Contains comment text, user, and photo details  
- Likes: Tracks user likes on photos
- Follows: Manages follower/following relationships between users
- Tags: Stores hashtag information
- Photo_Tags: Links photos to hashtags

## Skills Demonstrated

- Database schema design
- Advanced T-SQL querying
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Query optimization

## Sample Queries

The project includes queries to answer questions such as:

- Finding the most liked photo and its poster
- Calculating average user post frequency
- Identifying potential bot accounts
- Determining the most popular hashtags

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Import the provided SQL scripts to create the database schema and sample data
3. Run the analytical queries in your preferred SQL environment

## Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced analytics using window functions
- Add visualizations of key metrics
- Expand the dataset to include more realistic social media features
